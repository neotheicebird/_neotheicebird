neotheicebird
=============

An about-me page as a python library.

This python package contains information about me as a developer.

### Why do we need this package?

This package has 2 purposes:

1. Developers can simply install and import this package right from the console to know about me or my works. You can think of this package like a twitter handle and reaching to the tweets under the handle.

2. This project can be used to learn more about python packaging and deployment. You can learn the best practises used to create and deploy python packages to the PyPi index, by editing this minimal code. You can fork this project here: https://github.com/neotheicebird/neotheicebird.git

This is just like creating a Github account, or a Twitter account. Run a "commandline blog", create jokes, its all possible through a package.
